Quasi-particle spectrum of bulk diamond
=======================================

In the first part of the tutorial, the G0W0 calculator is introduced and the
quasi-particle spectrum of bulk diamond is calculated.


Groundstate calculation
-----------------------

First, we need to do a regular groundstate calculation. We do this in plane
wave mode and choose the LDA exchange-correlation functional. In order to
keep the computational efforts small, we start with (3x3x3) k-points and a
plane wave basis up to 300 eV.

.. literalinclude:: C_groundstate.py

It takes a few seconds on a single CPU. The last line in the script creates a
.gpw file which contains all the informations of the system, including the
wavefunctions.

.. note::

    You can change the number of bands to be written out by using
    ``calc.diagonalize_full_hamiltonian(nbands=...)``.
    This can be useful if not all bands are needed.

    
The GW calculator
-----------------

Next, we set up the G0W0 calculator and calculate the quasi-particle spectrum
for all the k-points present in the irreducible Brillouin zone from the ground
state calculation and the specified bands. 
In this case, each carbon atom has 4 valence electrons and the bands are double
occupied. Setting ``bands=(3,5)`` means including band index 3 and 4 which is
the highest occupied band and the lowest unoccupied band.

.. literalinclude:: C_gw.py

It takes about 30 seconds on a single CPU for the
:meth:`~gpaw.response.g0w0.G0W0.calculate` method to finish:

.. automethod:: gpaw.response.g0w0.G0W0.calculate

The dictionary is stored in ``C-g0w0_results.pckl``.  From the dict it is
for example possible to extract the direct bandgap at the Gamma point:

.. literalinclude:: get_gw_bandgap.py

with the result: 6.96 eV.

The possible input parameters of the G0W0 calculator are listed here:

.. autoclass:: gpaw.response.g0w0.G0W0


Convergence with respect to cutoff energy and number of k-points
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Can we trust the calculated value of the direct bandgap? Not yet. A check for
convergence with respect to the plane wave cutoff energy and number of k
points is necessary. This is done by changing the respective values in the
groundstate calculation and restarting. Script
:download:`C_ecut_k_conv_GW.py` carries out the calculations and
:download:`C_ecut_k_conv_plot_GW.py` plots the resulting data. It takes
several hours on a single xeon-8 CPU (8 cores). The resulting figure is
shown below.

A k-point sampling of (8x8x8) seems to give results converged to within 0.05 eV. 
The plane wave cutoff is usually converged by employing a `1/E^{3/2}_{\text{cut}}` extrapolation.
This can be done with the following script: :download:`C_ecut_extrap.py` resulting
in a direct band gap of 7.57 eV. The extrapolation is shown in the figure below

Frequency dependence
--------------------

Next, we should check the quality of the frequency grid used in the
calculation. Two parameters determine how the frequency grid looks.
``domega0`` and ``omega2``. Read more about these parameters in the tutorial
for the dielectric function :ref:`df_tutorial_freq`.

Running script :download:`C_frequency_conv.py` calculates the direct band
gap using different frequency grids with ``domega0`` varying from 0.005 to
0.05 and ``omega2`` from 1 to 25. The resulting data is plotted in
:download:`C_frequency_conv_plot.py` and the figure is shown below.

.. image:: C_freq.png
    :height: 400 px

Converged results are obtained for ``domega0=0.02`` and ``omega2=15``, which
is close to the default values.


Final results
-------------

A full G0W0 calculation with (8x8x8) k-points and extrapolated to infinite cutoff results in a direct band gap of 7.57 eV. Hence the value of 6.96 eV calculated at first was not converged!

Another method for carrying out the frequency integration is the Plasmon Pole
approximation (PPA). Read more about it here :ref:`gw_theory_ppa`. This is
turned on by setting ``ppa = True`` in the G0W0 calculator (see
:download:`C_converged_ppa.py`). Carrying out a full G0W0 calculation with the PPA 
using (8x8x8) k-points and extrapolating from calculations at a cutoff of 300 
and 400 eV gives a direct band gap of 7.52 eV, which is in very good agreement 
with the result for the full frequency integration but the calculation took 
only minutes.

.. note::

    If a calculation is very memory heavy, it is possible to set ``nblocks``
    to an integer larger than 1 but less than or equal to the amount of CPU 
    cores running the calculation. With this, the response function is divided 
    into blocks and each core gets to store a smaller matrix.

    
Quasi-particle spectrum of two-dimensional materials
====================================================
Carrying out a G0W0 calculation of a 2D system follows very much the same recipe
as outlined above for diamond. To avoid having to use a large amount of vacuum in 
the out-of-plane direction we advice to use a 2D truncated Coulomb interaction,
which is turned on by setting ``truncation = '2D'``. Additionally it is possible 
to add an analytical correction to the q=0 term of the Brillouin zone sampling
by specifying ``anisotropy_correction=True``. This means that a less dense k-point 
grid will be necessary to achieve convergence. More information about this 
specific method can be found here:

How to set up a 2D slab of MoS2 and calculate the band structure can be found in 
:download:`MoS2_gs_GW.py`. The results are not converged but a band gap of 2.57 eV 
is obtained. 
The band structure can be visualized with the :download:`MoS2_bs_plot.py` script
resulting in the figure below:

GW0 calculations
================
It is currently possible to add eigenvalue self-consistency in the Green's function. 
This is activated by setting ``method='GW0'``, specifying how many iterations you 
are interested in, ``maxiter=5`` and optionally also how much of the previous iteration's 
eigenvalues you want mixed in, ``mixing=0.5`` . Usually 5 iterations are enough to reach
convergence with a mixing of 50%. Only the bands specified will be updated self-consistently.
The bands above(below) the highest(lowest) included band will be shifted with the 
k-point averaged shift of the band below(above). 
The results after each iteration is printed in the output file.
The following script calculates the band gap of bulk BN within the GW0 approximation: 
:download:`BN_GW0.py`. The figure below shows the value of the gap during the first five 
iterations, where iteration zero is the DFT gap (:download:`BN_GW0_plot.py`). 
Note: The calculations are not converged with respect to k-points, frequency points or cutoff energy.
