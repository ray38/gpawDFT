Development
===========

GPAW development can be done by anyone! Just take a look at the
`issue tracker`_ and find something that suits your talents!

The primary source of information is still the :ref:`manual` and
:ref:`documentation`, but as a developer you might need additional
information which can be found here. For example the :ref:`code_overview`.

As a developer, you should subscribe to all GPAW related :ref:`mail lists`.
We would also like to encourage you to join our channel for :ref:`irc`.

Now you are ready to to perfom a :ref:`developer installation` and
start development!

.. note --- below toctrees are defined in separate files to make sure that the line spacing doesn't get very large (which is of course a bad hack)

Development topics
==================

When committing significant changes to the code, remember to add a
note in the :ref:`releasenotes` at the top (development version) - the
version to become the next release.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   codingstandard
   c_extension
   writing_documentation
   formulas
   debugging
   profiling
   testing
   ase_optimize/ase_optimize
   bugs
   newrelease
   technology
   benchmarks

* Details about supported :ref:`platforms and architectures`.

The developer guide provides an overview of the PAW quantities and how
the corresponding objects are defined in the code:

documentation is included in the other line counts.


Contributing to GPAW
====================

Getting commit access to the GPAW code works the same way as for
the :ref:`ASE project <ase:contribute>`.
